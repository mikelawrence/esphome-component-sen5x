    SEN55 Environmental Sensor
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend you use my [sen6x component](#sen6x-external-component) below or the ESPHome built-in sen6x component. This will not be updated frequently.

This external component adds SEN60, SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66, SEN68 and SEN69C support to the built-in sen5x component.

> [!NOTE]
> ESPHome now has a SEN6X component. They decided to not use my pull request that supported the SEN6X sensors in the SEN5X component after 6 months of work. Kinda sucked but it what it is. I ended up supporting the new SEN6X component integration but it's not really the way I would have handled it. I doubt I will support ESPHome directly in the future but I will release new components on Github separate fom ESPHome.

  By default, the RH/T acceleration algorithm is optimized for a sensor which is positioned in free air.
  If the sensor is integrated into another device, the ambient RH/T output values might not be optimal
  due to different thermal behavior.

  This parameter can be used to adapt the RH/T acceleration behavior for the actual use-case, leading in an
  improvement of the ambient RH/T output accuracy. There is a limited set of different modes available.
  Medium and high accelerations are particularly indicated for air quality monitors which are subjected to
  large temperature changes. Low acceleration is advised for stationary devices not subject to large
  variations in temperature.

  For more information see
  [Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions for SEN5x.](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/9B9DE2A7/61E957EB/Sensirion_Temperature_Acceleration_and_Compensation_Instructions_SEN.pdf).

* **address** (*Optional*, int): Manually specify the I²C address of the sensor. Defaults to `0x69` for
  SEN5X sensors and `0x6B` for SEN6X sensors.

### SEN5X Actions

Multiple actions are available with this component and all are mutually exclusive. Actions take time to complete.
While an individual action is running the sensor is otherwise occupied and cannot be accessed. Attempting to run
an action while another action is already running results in a 'Sensor is busy' log warning. Several actions also
require the sensor to be in the idle state with no measurements running.

#### SEN5X Fan Cleaning

Both sensor families support manual running of the fan cleaning cycle by using the
`sen5x.start_fan_autoclean` action. Only available with the SEN54, SEN55, SEN62, SEN63C, SEN65,
SEN66, SEN68 or SEN69C.

##### SEN5X `sen5x.start_fan_autoclean` Action

This [action](https://esphome.io/automations/actions/#actions) manually starts fan cleaning. During the fan cleaning
process sensor measurements are paused or stopped, depending on the sensor, while the fan is running at
the elevated rate. The entire fan cleaning sequence takes 12 seconds.

```yaml
on_...:
  then:
    - sen5x.start_fan_autoclean: sen54
```

You can emulate the SEN5X automatic fan cleaning on a SEN6X sensor by calling the `sen5x.start_fan_autoclean:`
action periodically.

For example, to clean the fan every 7 days while the device is on, as recommended by the manufacturer, the
following configuration can be added:

```yaml
interval:
  - interval: 7d
    then:
      - sen5x.start_fan_autoclean: my_sen66
```

#### SEN5X Humidity Sensor Heater

The SEN6X humidity sensor can develop an offset in the humidity reading when exposed to high levels of
humidity for extended periods of time. It supports a heater similar to the one in the SHT4X. The
difference is no automatic mode. Instead you have to trigger `sen5x.activate_heater` action occasionally.

##### SEN5X `activate_heater` Action

This [action](https://esphome.io/automations/actions/#actions) manually starts the heater. First all measurements are
stopped, then the heater is turned on at 200mW for 1s, finally there is a 20 second delay before
reenabling the measurements. This is to ensure the heating effects are gone before temperature measurements
resume. The entire activate heater sequence takes 22 seconds.

```yaml
on_...:
  then:
    - sen5x.activate_heater: my_sen66
```

#### SEN5X CO₂ Calibration

The CO₂ sensor by default has auto-calibration enabled. Auto-calibration will adjust the minimum measurement
over the last week or so to the outdoor average of slightly more than 400 ppm. Auto-calibration assumes that
you are opening the windows at least once a week. If you don't open the windows then over time the CO₂ level
will tend downward.

If you know your minimums are not going to be 400 ppm then you can disable auto-calibration and occasionally
take the sensor outside for 5 minutes and then force a manual CO₂ calibration to the expected outdoor CO₂ level.
Be sure to watch the log output of your device when you perform this action. If the sensor reports an error
during the recalibration process it will be reported in the log.

##### SEN5X `perform_forced_co2_recalibration` Action

This [action](https://esphome.io/automations/actions/#actions) forces a manual calibration on the CO₂ sensor. Measurements
are stopped before issuing the forced co2 recalibrate command to the sensor. The entire perform forced co2
recalibration action takes 2 seconds.

The example below will recalibrate the CO₂ sensor when the "CO₂ Calibrate" button is pressed using the
"CO₂ Calibration Value" number's current value.

```yaml
number:
  - platform: template
    id: co2_forced_cal_value
    name: "CO₂ Calibration Value"
    device_class: carbon_dioxide
    entity_category: CONFIG
    optimistic: true
    max_value: 1200
    min_value: 400
    step: 1
    initial_value: 420
button:
  - platform: template
    name: "CO₂ Calibrate"
    entity_category: CONFIG
    on_press:
      - sen5x.perform_forced_co2_recalibration:
          value: !lambda "return id(co2_forced_cal_value).state;"
          id: sen66_sensor
sensor:
  - platform: sen5x
    type: SEN66
    id: sen66_sensor
    co2:
      name: "CO₂"
```

#### SEN5X CO₂ Compensation

The CO₂ sensor supports pressure/altitude compensation to improve CO₂ accuracy. If a pressure sensor is available
you can dynamically adjust pressure compensation by either adding `ambient_pressure_compensation_source` to your
configuration for automatic updates or you can periodically call the `sen5x.set_ambient_pressure_compensation`
action with the current ambient pressure. You can also statically define `altitude_compensation`.

##### SEN5X Dynamic example with a local sensor

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: bmp581
    id: bmp581_sensor
    pressure:
      id: pressure_hpa
      filters:
        - lambda: |-
            // convert Pa to hPa (or mBar)
            return x * 0.01;
  - platform: sen5x
    type: SEN69C
    co2:
      name: "CO₂"
      ambient_pressure_compensation_source: pressure_hpa
```

##### SEN5X Dynamic example `set_ambient_pressure_compensation` Action

This [action](https://esphome.io/automations/actions/#actions) updates the current pressure used in CO₂ pressure compensation.
Must be in hPa or mBar. Note: Once `set_ambient_pressure_compensation` is called `altitude_compensation`, if
set in the configuration, will be ignored. Only available with SEN63C, SEN66 or SEN69C.

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: bmp581
    id: bmp581_sensor
    pressure:
      id: pressure_hpa
      filters:
        - lambda: |-
            // convert Pa to hPa (or mBar)
            return x * 0.01;
    on_value:
      then:
        - lambda: !lambda |-
            id(sen66_sensor).set_ambient_pressure_compensation(x);
  - platform: sen5x
    type: SEN69C
    id: sen66_sensor
    co2:
      name: "CO₂"
```

##### SEN5X Static example with altitude

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: sen5x
    type: SEN66
    co2:
      name: "CO₂"
      altitude_compensation: 427m
```

### SEN5X Automatic Fan Cleaning

The SEN5X sensors have an automatic fan-cleaning procedure will be triggered periodically following
`auto_cleaning_interval` cleaning interval. This will accelerate the fan to maximum speed for 10 seconds
to blow out the accumulated dust inside the fan.

* Measurement values are not updated while the fan-cleaning is running.
* The default cleaning interval is set to 604,800 seconds (i.e., 168 hours or 1 week).
* The interval can be configured using the Set Automatic Cleaning Interval command.
* Set the interval to 0 to disable the automatic cleaning.
* The cleaning procedure can also be started manually with the `start_fan_autoclean` Action.

### SEN5X NOx and VOC Algorithm Tuning

Both the NOx and VOC sensor support algorithm tuning. These variables are set with the `algorithm_tuning`
configuration under the `voc` and `nox` sensors. For more details see
[Engineering Guidelines for SEN5X](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/25AB572C/62B463AA/Sensirion_Engineering_Guidelines_SEN5x.pdf)

### SEN5X Temperature Compensation

The SEN54, SEN55, SEN62, SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66, SEN68 or SEN69C contain an internal temperature
compensation mechanism. The compensated ambient temperature is calculated as follows:

```c++
T_Ambient_Compensated = T_Ambient + (slope*T_Ambient) + offset
```

Where slope and offset are the values set with `temperature_compensation` configuration variables, smoothed
with the specified time constant, also a `temperature_compensation` configuration variable. The time constant
is how fast the slope and offset are applied. After the specified value in seconds, 63% of the new slope and
offset are applied.

More details about the tuning of these parameters for SEN5X sensors are included in the application note:
[Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions for SEN5x](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/9B9DE2A7/61E957EB/Sensirion_Temperature_Acceleration_and_Compensation_Instructions_SEN.pdf).

The SEN62, SEN63C, SEN65, SEN66, SEN68 or SEN69C support temperature compensation using the same formula
above but with the added feature of up to five slots. At this time only slot 0 is supported. A later update
will correct this issue.

More details about the tuning of these parameters for SEN6X sensors are included in the application note:
[SEN6x – Temperature Acceleration and Compensation Instructions](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/C964FCC8/693FD554/PS_AN_SEN6x_Temperature_Compensation_and_Acceleration_Application_No.pdf).
